# G.I.T.A. (Global Intelligence & Technical Analysis) ☢️

> *"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."*
> — **J. Robert Oppenheimer** (quoting the Bhagavad Gita)

## 🕯️ Project Manifesto

**G.I.T.A.** is not merely an acronym for *Global Intelligence & Technical Analysis*. It is a deliberate reference to the **Bhagavad Gita**, best known for the scripture J. Robert Oppenheimer recalled when he witnessed the first nuclear detonation.

This project is less of a game designed for entertainment, and more of an **interactive social awareness project**. It places you in the claustrophobic chair of a decision-maker, simulating the terrifying reality of the **1983 nuclear false alarm incident (Stanislav Petrov)** and the ruthless logic of the Soviet **"Dead Hand" (Perimeter)** system.

The goal is not to "win," but to experience the weight of a button that can end civilization. It questions whether human conscience or cold logic should dictate our survival in the atomic age.

(Oyun şu anda sadece Türkçe dil desteğine sahiptir. İngilizce sürüm yakında eklenecektir.)

# 🎮 Gameplay & Features
- Tension-Based Decision Mechanism: Radar data, seismic sensors, and satellite imagery don't always tell the truth. Is the attack real, or is it a system glitch? A wrong decision leads to M.A.D. (Mutually Assured Destruction).
- Dynamic Narrative System: The dialogue between the hawkish General Volkov and the cautious Captain Smirnov increases the psychological pressure on the player throughout the game.
- Immersive Audio Atmosphere: An engaging experience integrated using the System.Media library, featuring sirens, Soviet anthems, and alarm effects.
- Developer Terminal (Cheat Mode): A hidden command-line interface (CheatTerminal) within the game allows for real-time manipulation of simulation variables. You could open it by pressing the Q key.

# 🏁 4 Distinct Endings
Your choices define history:

🏆 Bloody Victory: The enemy is destroyed; the Motherland survives (but at what cost?).

💀 Total Defeat: We hesitated. The country is wiped off the map without firing back.

☢️ M.A.D. (Mutually Assured Destruction): Both sides annihilate each other. The world returns to the Stone Age.

🕊️ Peace: Composure prevails. The crisis is averted, and World is in peace. For now.
